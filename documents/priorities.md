This is just to motivate myself to write code lol.
I've just started.

# The Scope of Curo
Curo isn't a normal esolang.  
Esolangs are either designed to be difficult to program in, focus on golfing/speed or are just weird.  
Curo tries to acheive two of the criteries.

## 1. Estoric
The main goal of Curo is to be as estoric as possible, but with still being manageble to program in.

## 2. Golfy
The second focus of Curo is golfiness.  
Even though you have to sacrify some of the golfing bits to the estoric part, it's still shorter than some other golfing languages.
